# Facial-Reconstruction
Using Deep RBMs to demo repair of corrupted facial imagery.

This project uses inspiration from an applied research paper to use various Restricted Boltzmann Machine architectures for realtime reconstruction of facial images.

Things coming up:
- Links to both my writeup regarding my results and the original paper
- Improve the model as much as possible
- Refine this repository to be a better guide
- More settings with regards to breaking images and seeing reconstruction
- Potentially different database altogether
